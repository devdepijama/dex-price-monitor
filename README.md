# dex-price-monitor
A simple CLI for keeping track of crypto assets being traded in DEX (Descentralized exchanges)

# Motivation
Differently than a regular CEX (Centralized exchange) a DEX does not necessarily have an "order book" that determines the price based on floating bid and ask prices suggested by buyers and sellers.
Instead, the price is defined by the amount of tokens held in a liquidity pool.
